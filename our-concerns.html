                    The current Board of Directors ran on a platform of fiduciary responsibility and oversight in
                    addition to transparency. There has been no complete financial reporting (on the operating and DMCF
                    budgets) to the residents and the Board's own Finance Advisory Committee since March. We would like
                    to see a return to professionally prepared monthly financials which are required to effectively
                    operate the Foundation.

                    Return to in-house Management
                </h6>
                <p class="paragraph-text fw-normal">
                    After assuring the residents of Longshore Lake at Candidates Night, through emails published to the
                    community, at the first Board of Directors Meeting in April through a PowerPoint presentation, and
                    at a Coffee with the General Manager that the Board was committed to our own in-house management and
                    staff employed by the Foundation, they quickly broke their word. At a meeting of the Past Presidents
                    Council Mr. Marino assured the group that they would never hire a management company without a vote
                    of the community. We need answers to the total costs and scope of the new contract. They assumed
                    office in March and contacted KW Pr operty Management Company in April. No efforts were made to
                    interview and hire employees as they resigned, except for the GM position.

                    To a group whose cornerstone of their campaign was “TRANSPARENCY”, we have seen little of it. The
                    BOD has the bully pulpit of the email system and should be communicating with the residents on a
                    weekly basis. When there isn’t clear directives and information…people just fill in the blanks with
                    rumors and innuendo. Effective communication was promised.

                    A Continuing Polarization of Longshore Lake
                </h6>
                <p class="paragraph-text fw-normal">
                    There has been and continues to be a schism in our wonderful community. The polarization of
                    Longshore Lake residents is sad to observe. We know when emergencies strike- like hurricanes, all
                    our neighbors come together to help one another. A priority for leadership should be the healing of
                    this rift. We yearn for a return to a Longshore Lake where decisions made are member driven. “A
                    house divided against itself can not stand”.
                    Now you know.
